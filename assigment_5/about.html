    <p> Barbara was known for writing stories purely for kids, getting into the mind of a child by
        <br /> looking at a problem the simplest way possible and not analyising too much like adults do. 
        <br /> She didn't consider herself to be an adult at heart, and never bothered to write a children's book.
        <br /> When she was a child, she knew the path to the principals office despite later wanting to become a teacher.
