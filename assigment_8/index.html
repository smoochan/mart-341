                <p>Pulling down backstreets deep in your head <br />
                    Slipping through dreamland like a tourist <br />
                    Pulling down backstreets deep in your head <br />
                    Slipping through dreamland like a tourist </p>

                <p> That first friend you had, that worst thing you said <br />
                    That perfect moment, that last tear you shed <br />
                    All you done in bed? All on Memorex <br />
                    All around your head, all around your head</p>

                <p> Pulling down backstreets deep in your head <br />
                    Slipping through dreamland like a tourist <br />
                    Pulling down backstreets deep in your head <br />
                    Slipping through dreamland like a tourist </p>

                <p> You've had too much of the digital love <br />
                    You want everything live, you want things you can touch <br />
                    Make it feel like like a movie you saw in your youth <br />
                    Make it feel like that song that just unopened you <br />
                    You were ten years old holding hands in the classroom <br />
                    He had a gun on the first day of highschool <br />
                    You want something bizarre, old conceptual cars <br />
                    You want girls dressed in drag, you want boys with guitars </p>

                <p> Pulling down backstreets deep in your head <br />
                    Slipping through dreamland like a tourist <br />
                    Pulling down backstreets deep in your head <br />
                    Slipping through dreamland like a tourist </p>

                <p> You see Kodachrome, you see pink and gold <br />
                    You see Mullholland glow, you see in airplane mode <br />
                    All around your head, all around your head <br />
                    All around your head, all 'round 'round your head </p>

                <p> You float in the pool where the soundtrack is canned <br />
                    You go ask your questions like, "What makes a man?" <br />
                    Oh, it's 2020 so it's time to change that <br />
                    So you go make an album and call it Dreamland</p>
