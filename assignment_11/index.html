            <h2>
                <i>-- Why are you so alone?</i>
            </h2>
            <p>

                The question hangs in the air for them, as they are led down to the altar of the moon goddess. They still don’t understand this place-- and they especially don’t know why they are here. All that they know is that they have to make a confession of some sort to appeal to two lonely gods so that they don’t kill the Drifter a second time. At the very least, it sounds easier than having to fight Judgement in a desperate bid for the truth. Or at least, they hoped.
                
                They kneel down before the altar, feeling it proper to bow before the goddess of the moon. After all, she was one of the reasons they were all about to die, so might as well pay respect to her. It wouldn’t make sense doing anything other than try to appease her anyway. Even if he had no idea what exactly she represented. Or if signing to her would really work. Would two gods understand sign language? It’s not like they could write to them, or send them a quick message.
                
                Well.. All they had to do was try, right? </p>
                
                <p>Raising their hands in the air, they would pause for a moment before starting, considering their choice of words. Whatever they said could be the difference between a destroyed set of planets, and Drifter getting to live on another day. A deep breath was taken before they continued, still unsure but confident they could think of something. </p>
                
                <p><b> ‘Hello, goddess of the moon,' </b>they sign, <b>'I hope that you can understand me. I’m sorry I don’t know your proper name, I only just got here. I am told that confessing my feelings to you would somehow help you be less lonely, or something.. So here I am.’ </b>
                
                They pause again, cursing at themselves for being so blunt. </p>
                
               <p> <b>‘I guess my confession would be that.. I wish I had more time. I’ll explain what I mean by that. You see, where I come from, there was a tragedy that happened before my time. It caused my land, and some of its people, to become sick. I also became ill searching for the way to become immortal- to give myself more time. ‘  </b>
                
                Their hands begin to shake. They take another deep breath, feeling their chest tighten. They write it off as fear.
