1. I'm used to things like p, i, and br, and familiar with even div's a slight bit from experimenting with blog HTML. however table, email, and especially input were new to me- and I feel as though I'm still having to relearn how to do forms and tables half of the time. It's like there's a lot of steps to do something that seems so simple. 
2. PRETTY! COLORS! I'm so excited. I can't wait to make my browsers either as pretty or as eye-ball melting as I please (provided it doesn't doc my grade, lol)
3. You know a little bit about my challenges this week- but I'm realizing that as things get more difficult with HTML I need to spread out my workload more. I'm finding that leaving and coming back to assignments later is more effective than trying to bash my head against it all in one go. :') Especially after hard days at work.
